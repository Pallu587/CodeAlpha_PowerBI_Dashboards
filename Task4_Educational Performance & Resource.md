###### **About the Project**  

###### This is another task from my Power BI internship with CodeAlpha.  

###### The dashboard is made for schools/colleges to analyze student performance and also see how resources (teachers, labs, budgets) are being used.  

###### It can help in identifying gaps and making better academic decisions.

######  ***What I Did***  

###### \- Visualized student performance with subject-wise and overall results.  

###### \- Added charts to track \*\*resource allocation (faculty, facilities, and budgets).

###### \- Made the dashboard interactive with filters for class/department.

###### **Tools Used**
