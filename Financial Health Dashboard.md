#  **Financial Health Dashboard**  





###### 

####  **About the Project**  

###### This is the first task of my Power BI internship with CodeAlpha.  

###### I built a Financial Health Dashboard that shows how an organizationâ€™s income, expenses, profit, and cash flow change over time.  

###### The main idea was to create something simple but useful for analyzing overall financial performance.  

###### 

#### **What I Did**  

###### \- Compared monthly income vs. expenses to see trends clearly.  

###### \- Created a profit trend chart to track how profit changes month by month.  

###### \- Added an expense breakdown (for May) to show where the money is going (salaries, rent, utilities, etc.).  

###### \- Built a cash inflow vs. outflow chart to check liquidity.  

###### \- Added a net profit card for a quick overview.  

###### 

#### **Tools Used**  

###### \- Power BI Desktop  

###### \- DAX formulas for profit calculations  

###### \- Power Query for data cleaning
